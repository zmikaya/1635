#Functions

#1. start with Server IP providedin args[]
#2. Attempt establish communication with DisplayServer
#3. Connect with DisplayServer
#4. Repeatedly "pull" data from server? (alternatively server pushes to all DisplayClients)
#5. [PLACEHOLDER] constantly print vehicle positions from DisplayServer
